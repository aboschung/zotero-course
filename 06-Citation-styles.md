In this part, you will learn of to change citation styles and how to add new citation styles. 

## Citation styles : what do they do ? 
Citation styles change how citations appears in your texts and the way metadata is displayed when you create a bibliography. 

Usually, a citation style will have rules about which metadata to display for each document type and how to format the citation. These citation styles can be defined by publishers, scientific societies or individuals, for instance. Theortically, you could apply the citation rules manually, but Zotero will be faster and more consistent. 

It is possible to modify or create one own's citation style, but this will be the topic of another course.
