##Discover Zotero's functionalities  
Well done! You have installed Zotero on your computer. What do you find in your Zotero Library

As an iTunes Library, your Zotero Library is a list of items = your references.  

Items/references are added by clicking on the Zotero connector in your browser or by drag-and-dropping the references from the webpage to your library (URLs). You can also add references in Zotero by import or manually. 

###Exercice 4.1: Collect references in your Zotero library

Add 5 references in your Zotero library. Try adding references of various doctypes:  

1. book 
2. paper 
3. conference paper
4. wikimedia commons imag
5. thesis  


###Exercice 4.2 : Search a reference

Find at least two ways of searching a reference in your library.

##Manage your Zotero Library: Collections, subcollections

Your Zotero Library is organized in columns: first colum is usually the arborescence of your files / collections.   You can create as many files / collections and subcollections as you want. Each item / reference will appear two times: first occurence is in your Library, and second occurence is in the collection if you put it in one of your collections.  Items that are not filed are listed in the "Unfiled Items" file. 

###Exercice 4.3 : Create and manage your collections

Create a collection. Put some of your references in this new collection. Click on one of the references and delete it from the collection, but not from your Library. Which option should you select?

Solution: "Remove item from Collection" // "Move item to trash" 

###Exercice 4.4 : "Duplicate Items" collection 
What is this file  made for?


## Check the metadata of your item: Record Fields Doctype
Now that you are familiar with your collections and the list of your items, let's have a look on the record of each of your item.

Where do you see the metadata of each of your reference?
Clicking on one of your references, you see that the third column is full of details like in the following example...

###Exercice 4.5: Modify the type of an item and some fields of a record

Depending on the metadata found on the webpage by Zotero, some modifications of a record in your Library can be necessary. Check the items you just collected. Is the item Type field always correct? If not, modify it.

Solution: To modify the type of your item, you just have to correct the field and to select the right type in the list proposed by Zotero. You see that depending on the type of item, fiels of the record change.

Which are the main fields for the reference of a journal article?
