## Exercises

Your Zotero Library is organized in columns: first colum is usually the arborescence of your files / collections.   You can create as many files / collections and subcollections as you want. Each item / reference will appear two times: first occurence is in your Library, and second occurence is in the collection if you put it in one of your collections.  Items that are not filed are listed in the "Unfiled Items" file. 

### exercice 4.3 : Create and manage your collections

Create a collection. Put some of your references in this new collection. Click on one of the references and delete it from the collection, but not from your Library.   
Which option should you select?


### exercice 4.4 : "Duplicate Items" collection 

What is this file made for?

Now that you are familiar with your collections and the list of your items, let's have a look on the record of each of your item.

Where do you see the metadata of each of your reference?
Clicking on one of your references, you see that the third column is full of details like in the following example...

### exercice 4.5: Modify the type of an item and some fields of a record

Depending on the metadata found on the webpage by Zotero, some modifications of a record in your Library can be necessary. Check the items you just collected. Is the item type field always correct? If not, modify it.   
Which are the main fields for the reference of a journal article?


### exercice 4.6: Keep track of your readings

Solution: Click on a item and consult its record. Click on the "Note" page of the record and write some notes. A new attached file is created. When searching it in your items list, "All Fields" search includes the keywords present in your notes :)
