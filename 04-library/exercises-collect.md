##  Exercises

### exercise 4.1: Collect references

Add 5 references in your Zotero library. Try adding references of various doctypes:   

1. book   
2. paper   
3. conference paper   
4. Wikimedia Commons image   
5. thesis   


### exercise 4.2 : Search for a reference

Find at least two ways of searching a reference in your library.   
Try the advanced search and save the result.   
The collection created from that search is dynamic: every new reference matching the query you used in the avdanced search will be added automatically in this collection.

### exercise 4.3 : Check for the full text version of the document

Select a batch of references with no attachments. References with attachments have a blue dot on the side.

Use the "Find available PDFs" feature to check PDFs availability. Zotero will import full text version of the document when available.
