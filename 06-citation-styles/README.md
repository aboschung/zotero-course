Usually, a citation style will have rules about which metadata to display for each document type and how to format the citation. These citation styles can be defined by publishers, scientific societies or individuals, for instance. Theoretically, you could apply the citation rules manually, but Zotero will be faster and more consistent. 

It is possible to modify or create one own's citation style, but this will be the topic of another course.
