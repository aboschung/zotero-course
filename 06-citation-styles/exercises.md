## Exercises

### Exercise 6.1: Your supervisor/publisher requires that you use a citation style called Copernicus

Copernicus is not listed in the short list! How can you add it to the citation styles list in Zotero?Â 

Solution: Zotero button --> document preferences --> click on "manage styles",  [a Zotero pop-up appears]     click on "obtain more styles", select the style Copernicus in the list, click on "OK". Then, try again to add your citation and choose Copernicus in the list.


### Exercise 6.2: Your paper is finished but... 

... your supervisor changes his mind and would like you to cite and deliver a bibliography using the IEEE style. Arrrgghh!! What can you do?

Solution: in your word processor: Zotero button --> document preferences --> choose the IEEE citation style --> OK. You can refresh if it you cannot see the changes right away.

NB: It is possible to adapt any existing style or to create a new one (much more time-consuming, though) if your dream style does not exist yet.
