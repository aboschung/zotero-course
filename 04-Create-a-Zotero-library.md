# Create a Zotero Library

## Structure of the library
Your Zotero library will contain all the references you add into your library. You can create subsets of your library by adding "collections".

## Collecting references
A reference consists of metadata describing a document and allowing you to find the document again. Zotero structures the metadata you collect about documents. When you cite your documents with Zotero, it will then generate consistent bibliographies. Zotero also allows you to store digital files along with the references.

It is best to collect metadata while you are in the process of looking for information. By that, we mean that you will be more efficient if you directly collect the metadata while you are on the website / database / library catalog where you find your documents because you won't need to find the reference a second time afterward.

### With Zotero Connector
The Zotero Connector is the plug-in that you installed in your browser. This plug-ins will detect the metadata available on the page you are visiting. The quality of the metadata depends on what the authors of the page have made available. 
Open Zotero and click on the Zotero connector icon in your browser : the reference will be automatically sent to your Zotero.

### With RIS or BibTeX 
Some databases or catalogs can provide you with a downloable file containing one or more references. The most common formats for these kind of files are RIS (.ris) or BibTeX (.bib).

### Become a librarian : manually adding references
Sometimes, there is no available metadata encoded in the page you are visiting. Or the document you have in your hands is not catalogued in a digital catalog. You will need to create or edit the reference yourself. 

In Zotero, you can create a new item by clicking on "File">"New Item" or on the green circle with a plus. Either way, you will need to choose the type of document you want to create a reference for (ie "Book", "Report", etc.). When you select the type of document you want to create, a blank reference will appear. You can now fill the fields according to the document you have in front of you. In all cases, it is best to be exhaustive as possible and to fill out as much information as possible.

### With a unique identifier (DOI, PMID, ISBN). 
Documents are often attributed a unique identifier: this helps when you have a copy of this document and you want to add the reference to Zotero. 

In Zotero, click on the magic wand icon in the top bar. A field will appear. In this field, type the identifier of the document you have at your disposal. Press enter. A new reference will be added to your library.

### From a PDF
If you have stored PDFs on your computer without directly adding them in Zotero with their metadata, it is sometimes possible to obtain comprehensive metadata afterwards. 

You will need to add the PDF in Zotero, dragging it from a folder and dropping it in your library. Then, do a right-click on the newly added PDF file and click on "Retrieve metadata for PDF". Zotero will search for metadata and automatically create a reference containing the metadata along with the PDF file when possible. However, it might be that the PDF yoz added to your Zotero library is not machine-readable or is not recognized by Zotero. In that case, no metadata will be retrieved.

You can also retrieve metadata for with several PDFs at the same time.
