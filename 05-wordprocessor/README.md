# From Zotero to the word processor

Zotero integrated very well with Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and OpenOffice Writer.
There are several ways to add references from a Zotero library in a word processor.

How do Zotero and the word processor interact? First, both Zotero and the word processor have to be turned on. Then, to be able to use the interactive features, you need to have a Zotero button in your word processor. Can you see it? If not, in Zotero: edit --> preferences --> citation --> word processor: reinstall if this is not done.
