## From Zotero to the word processor

Zotero integrated very well with Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and OpenOffice Writer.
There are several ways to add references from a Zotero library in a word processor.

First, both Zotero and the word processor have to be open. Then, to be able to use the interactive features, you need to have a Zotero button in your word processor. Can you see it? If not, in Zotero, open the Preferences panel and go to *Cite > Word Processors* and click on the "reinstall [name of the word processor] Add-in" button.
