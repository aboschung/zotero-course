# Using WebDav storage : how to set SWITCHdrive up

EPFL members and  members of universtities and institutions of 
higher education in Switzerland can use [SWITCHdrive](https://www.switch.ch/drive/). 
SWITCHdrive gives 50 GB of space to use as a free cloud storage (to store files, for instance).

SWITCHdrive can also be used to get more storage for your Zotero library.
When you start using Zotero with an account on [zotero.org](zotero.org), you freely get access to 300 MB of storage on Zotero's server. 

This space is used to synchronise your libraries on several computers and to provide you with an online version of your library, 
accessible via an internet browser. 

SWITCHdrive can do the same, except with a much higher storage size !

**If you want to benefit from this space, here is how :**

1. Register on 
[SWITCHdrive registration page](https://eduid.ch/web/registration/method/?target=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.eduid.ch%2Fidp%2Fprofile%2FSAML2%2FUnsolicited%2FSSO%3FproviderId%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcloud-id.switch.ch%252Fshibboleth%26target%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcloud-id.switch.ch%252Fregister%252Fdrive)

2. Open Zotero and go to Preferences > Sync

3. From this pane, you can change your synchronisation settings. Make sure data syncing is set up. You will need to have a Zotero account for this.

4. From the same pane, you can choose which file storage to use. Choose "WebDAV", as shown below.
